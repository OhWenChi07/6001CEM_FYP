    <string name="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy for Grocerly. Last updated October 16, 2023

\n\nThis Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Grocerly ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and safeguards your personal information when you use our Android app, Grocerly. By using our app, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to our application named Grocerly, and its associated subdomains (collectively, our \"Service\"). By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

\n\n1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
\nWe collect information from you when you visit our service, register, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey, or fill out a form.
\n• Name / Username
\n• Phone Numbers
\n• Email Addresses
\n• Password

\n\nWe also collect information from mobile devices for a better user experience, although these features are completely optional:
\n• Location (GPS): Location data Location data helps to create an accurate representation of your interests, and this can be used to bring more targeted and relevant ads to potential customers.

\n\n2. HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
	\n· To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)
	\n· To improve our service (we continually strive to improve our service offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)
	\n· To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)

\n\n3. COULD MY INFORMATION BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER COUNTRIES?
\nWe are incorporated in Malaysia. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans- border transfer and hosting of such information.

\n\n4. IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SERVICE SECURE?
\nWe take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are fool proof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes, or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.

\n\n5. CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY INFORMATION?
\nThe rights you must request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for always maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed, or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.

\n\n6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
\nWe keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfil the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we\'ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can\'t identify you.

\n\n7. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?
\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

\n\n8. YOUR CONSENT
\nBy using our service, registering an account, or making a purchase, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
